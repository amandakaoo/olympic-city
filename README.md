Although modern Olympics had been hosted across the world, the first modern Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. I modified my map showing Europe instead of other continents. I input the map's `setView([47.439507010492406, 11.520193473460449], 3.0`. 

The five-rings with the White background of the Olympic Symbol is the icon when people think of the Olympic, which represent the five continents of the world: Europe, Asia, Africa, The Americas, and Oceania. The union of the five continents and the meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games is the meaning of the Olympic Rings. When we look at the map, we can see that the Olympics games have never hosted in an African country. As many of us may know, it takes billions of dollars for a city to host the Olympics or any major International Sports Events. There are pros and cons to hosting such a big game. This may be an interesting topic to discuss in future research. 

When I found the data from https://architectureofthegames.net/, it provides me the data of the Summer Olympic Games from year 1896 to 2016 but Winter Olympic Games from year 1924 to 2026.
